DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ddaasshh is the standard command interpreter for the system.  The current version of ddaasshh is in the process of
     being changed to conform with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the shell.  This version has
     many features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn shell
     clone (see ksh(1)).  Only features designated by POSIX, plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorpo‐
     rated into this shell.  This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the
     shell.

   OOvveerrvviieeww
     The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally
     executes other commands.  It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a
     user can select a different shell with the chsh(1) command).  The shell implements a language that has flow
     control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along
     with built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features to aid interactive use
     and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive
     use (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a
     file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

   IInnvvooccaattiioonn
     If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal (or if the --ii flag
     is set), and the --cc option is not present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.  An interactive
     shell generally prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently (as
     described below).  When first starting, the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a dash ‘-’,
     the shell is also considered a login shell.  This is normally done automatically by the system when the
     user first logs in.  A login shell first reads commands from the files _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_f_i_l_e and _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e if they
     exist.  If the environment variable ENV is set on entry to an interactive shell, or is set in the _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e
     of a login shell, the shell next reads commands from the file named in ENV.  Therefore, a user should place
     commands that are to be executed only at login time in the _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file, and commands that are executed
     for every interactive shell inside the ENV file.  To set the ENV variable to some file, place the following
     line in your _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e of your home directory

           ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV

     substituting for “.shinit” any filename you wish.

     If command line arguments besides the options have been specified, then the shell treats the first argument
     as the name of a file from which to read commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as
     the positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).  Otherwise, the shell reads commands from its stan‐
     dard input.

   AArrgguummeenntt LLiisstt PPrroocceessssiinngg
     All of the single letter options that have a corresponding name can be used as an argument to the --oo
     option.  The set --oo name is provided next to the single letter option in the description below.  Specifying
     a dash “-” turns the option on, while using a plus “+” disables the option.  The following options can be
     set from the command line or with the sseett builtin (described later).

           --aa _a_l_l_e_x_p_o_r_t     Export all variables assigned to.

           --cc               Read commands from the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___s_t_r_i_n_g operand instead of from the standard input.
                            Special parameter 0 will be set from the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___n_a_m_e operand and the positional
                            parameters ($1, $2, etc.)  set from the remaining argument operands.

           --CC _n_o_c_l_o_b_b_e_r     Don't overwrite existing files with “>”.

           --ee _e_r_r_e_x_i_t       If not interactive, exit immediately if any untested command fails.  The exit status
                            of a command is considered to be explicitly tested if the command is used to control
                            an iiff, eelliiff, wwhhiillee, or uunnttiill; or if the command is the left hand operand of an “&&”
                            or “||” operator.

           --ff _n_o_g_l_o_b        Disable pathname expansion.

           --nn _n_o_e_x_e_c        If not interactive, read commands but do not execute them.  This is useful for
                            checking the syntax of shell scripts.

           --uu _n_o_u_n_s_e_t       Write a message to standard error when attempting to expand a variable that is not
                            set, and if the shell is not interactive, exit immediately.

           --vv _v_e_r_b_o_s_e       The shell writes its input to standard error as it is read.  Useful for debugging.

           --xx _x_t_r_a_c_e        Write each command to standard error (preceded by a ‘+ ’) before it is executed.
                            Useful for debugging.

           --II _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f     Ignore EOF's from input when interactive.

           --ii _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e   Force the shell to behave interactively.

           --ll               Make dash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell.

           --mm _m_o_n_i_t_o_r       Turn on job control (set automatically when interactive).

           --ss _s_t_d_i_n         Read commands from standard input (set automatically if no file arguments are
                            present).  This option has no effect when set after the shell has already started
                            running (i.e. with sseett).

           --VV _v_i            Enable the built-in vi(1) command line editor (disables --EE if it has been set).

           --EE _e_m_a_c_s         Enable the built-in emacs(1) command line editor (disables --VV if it has been set).

           --bb _n_o_t_i_f_y        Enable asynchronous notification of background job completion.  (UNIMPLEMENTED for
                            4.4alpha)

           --pp _p_r_i_v          Do not attempt to reset effective uid if it does not match uid. This is not set by
                            default to help avoid incorrect usage by setuid root programs via system(3) or
                            popen(3).

   LLeexxiiccaall SSttrruuccttuurree
     The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into words at whitespace (blanks and
     tabs), and at certain sequences of characters that are special to the shell called “operators”.  There are
     two types of operators: control operators and redirection operators (their meaning is discussed later).
     Following is a list of operators:

           Control operators:
                 & && ( ) ; ;; | || <newline>

           Redirection operators:
                 < > >| << >> <& >& <<- <>

   QQuuoottiinngg
     Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell, such as opera‐
     tors, whitespace, or keywords.  There are three types of quoting: matched single quotes, matched double
     quotes, and backslash.

   BBaacckkssllaasshh
     A backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following character, with the exception of ⟨newline⟩.  A
     backslash preceding a ⟨newline⟩ is treated as a line continuation.

   SSiinnggllee QQuuootteess
     Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal meaning of all the characters (except single
     quotes, making it impossible to put single-quotes in a single-quoted string).

   DDoouubbllee QQuuootteess
     Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal meaning of all characters except dollarsign
     ($), backquote (`), and backslash (\).  The backslash inside double quotes is historically weird, and
     serves to quote only the following characters:
           $ ` " \ <newline>.
     Otherwise it remains literal.

   RReesseerrvveedd WWoorrddss
     Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell and are recognized at the beginning of a
     line and after a control operator.  The following are reserved words:

           !       elif    fi      while   case
           else    for     then    {       }
           do      done    until   if      esac

     Their meaning is discussed later.

   AAlliiaasseess
     An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the alias(1) builtin command.  Whenever a reserved
     word may occur (see above), and after checking for reserved words, the shell checks the word to see if it
     matches an alias.  If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its value.  For example, if there is
     an alias called “lf” with the value “ls -F”, then the input:

           lf foobar ⟨return⟩

     would become

           ls -F foobar ⟨return⟩

     Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create shorthands for commands without having to learn
     how to create functions with arguments.  They can also be used to create lexically obscure code.  This use
     is discouraged.

   CCoommmmaannddss
     The shell interprets the words it reads according to a language, the specification of which is outside the
     scope of this man page (refer to the BNF in the POSIX 1003.2 document).  Essentially though, a line is read
     and if the first word of the line (or after a control operator) is not a reserved word, then the shell has
     recognized a simple command.  Otherwise, a complex command or some other special construct may have been
     recognized.

   SSiimmppllee CCoommmmaannddss
     If a simple command has been recognized, the shell performs the following actions:

           1.   Leading words of the form “name=value” are stripped off and assigned to the environment of the
                simple command.  Redirection operators and their arguments (as described below) are stripped off
                and saved for processing.

           2.   The remaining words are expanded as described in the section called “Expansions”, and the first
                remaining word is considered the command name and the command is located.  The remaining words
                are considered the arguments of the command.  If no command name resulted, then the “name=value”
                variable assignments recognized in item 1 affect the current shell.

           3.   Redirections are performed as described in the next section.

   RReeddiirreeccttiioonnss
     Redirections are used to change where a command reads its input or sends its output.  In general, redirec‐
     tions open, close, or duplicate an existing reference to a file.  The overall format used for redirection
     is:

           [n] _r_e_d_i_r_-_o_p _f_i_l_e

     where _r_e_d_i_r_-_o_p is one of the redirection operators mentioned previously.  Following is a list of the possi‐
     ble redirections.  The [n] is an optional number, as in ‘3’ (not ‘[3]’), that refers to a file descriptor.

           [n]> file   Redirect standard output (or n) to file.

           [n]>| file  Same, but override the --CC option.

           [n]>> file  Append standard output (or n) to file.

           [n]< file   Redirect standard input (or n) from file.

           [n1]<&n2    Duplicate standard input (or n1) from file descriptor n2.

           [n]<&-      Close standard input (or n).

           [n1]>&n2    Duplicate standard output (or n1) to n2.

           [n]>&-      Close standard output (or n).

           [n]<> file  Open file for reading and writing on standard input (or n).

     The following redirection is often called a “here-document”.

           [n]<< delimiter
                 here-doc-text ...
           delimiter

     All the text on successive lines up to the delimiter is saved away and made available to the command on
     standard input, or file descriptor n if it is specified.  If the delimiter as specified on the initial line
     is quoted, then the here-doc-text is treated literally, otherwise the text is subjected to parameter expan‐
     sion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion (as described in the section on “Expansions”).  If the
     operator is “<<-” instead of “<<”, then leading tabs in the here-doc-text are stripped.

   SSeeaarrcchh aanndd EExxeeccuuttiioonn
     There are three types of commands: shell functions, builtin commands, and normal programs -- and the com‐
     mand is searched for (by name) in that order.  They each are executed in a different way.

     When a shell function is executed, all of the shell positional parameters (except $0, which remains
     unchanged) are set to the arguments of the shell function.  The variables which are explicitly placed in
     the environment of the command (by placing assignments to them before the function name) are made local to
     the function and are set to the values given.  Then the command given in the function definition is exe‐
     cuted.  The positional parameters are restored to their original values when the command completes.  This
     all occurs within the current shell.

     Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without spawning a new process.

     Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or builtin, the command is searched for as a normal
     program in the file system (as described in the next section).  When a normal program is executed, the
     shell runs the program, passing the arguments and the environment to the program.  If the program is not a
     normal executable file (i.e., if it does not begin with the "magic number" whose ASCII representation is
     "#!", so execve(2) returns ENOEXEC then) the shell will interpret the program in a subshell.  The child
     shell will reinitialize itself in this case, so that the effect will be as if a new shell had been invoked
     to handle the ad-hoc shell script, except that the location of hashed commands located in the parent shell
     will be remembered by the child.

     Note that previous versions of this document and the source code itself misleadingly and sporadically refer
     to a shell script without a magic number as a "shell procedure".

   PPaatthh SSeeaarrcchh
     When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name.  Then it
     looks for a builtin command by that name.  If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:

     1.   Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing any searches.

     2.   The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the command.  The value of the PATH variable should
          be a series of entries separated by colons.  Each entry consists of a directory name.  The current
          directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.

   CCoommmmaanndd EExxiitt SSttaattuuss
     Each command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour of other shell commands.  The paradigm is
     that a command exits with zero for normal or success, and non-zero for failure, error, or a false indica‐
     tion.  The man page for each command should indicate the various exit codes and what they mean.  Addition‐
     ally, the builtin commands return exit codes, as does an executed shell function.

     If a command consists entirely of variable assignments then the exit status of the command is that of the
     last command substitution if any, otherwise 0.

   CCoommpplleexx CCoommmmaannddss
     Complex commands are combinations of simple commands with control operators or reserved words, together
     creating a larger complex command.  More generally, a command is one of the following:

     ··   simple command

     ··   pipeline

     ··   list or compound-list

     ··   compound command

     ··   function definition

     Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command is that of the last simple command executed by the
     command.

   PPiippeelliinneess
     A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the control operator |.  The standard output
     of all but the last command is connected to the standard input of the next command.  The standard output of
     the last command is inherited from the shell, as usual.

     The format for a pipeline is:

           [!] command1 [| command2 ...]

     The standard output of command1 is connected to the standard input of command2.  The standard input, stan‐
     dard output, or both of a command is considered to be assigned by the pipeline before any redirection spec‐
     ified by redirection operators that are part of the command.

     If the pipeline is not in the background (discussed later), the shell waits for all commands to complete.

     If the reserved word ! does not precede the pipeline, the exit status is the exit status of the last com‐
     mand specified in the pipeline.  Otherwise, the exit status is the logical NOT of the exit status of the
     last command.  That is, if the last command returns zero, the exit status is 1; if the last command returns
     greater than zero, the exit status is zero.

     Because pipeline assignment of standard input or standard output or both takes place before redirection, it
     can be modified by redirection.  For example:

           $ command1 2>&1 | command2

     sends both the standard output and standard error of command1 to the standard input of command2.

     A ; or ⟨newline⟩ terminator causes the preceding AND-OR-list (described next) to be executed sequentially;
     a & causes asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR-list.

     Note that unlike some other shells, each process in the pipeline is a child of the invoking shell (unless
     it is a shell builtin, in which case it executes in the current shell -- but any effect it has on the envi‐
     ronment is wiped).

   BBaacckkggrroouunndd CCoommmmaannddss ---- &&
     If a command is terminated by the control operator ampersand (&), the shell executes the command asyn‐
     chronously -- that is, the shell does not wait for the command to finish before executing the next command.

     The format for running a command in background is:

           command1 & [command2 & ...]

     If the shell is not interactive, the standard input of an asynchronous command is set to _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.

     A list is a sequence of zero or more commands separated by newlines, semicolons, or ampersands, and option‐
     ally terminated by one of these three characters.  The commands in a list are executed in the order they
     are written.  If command is followed by an ampersand, the shell starts the command and immediately proceed
     onto the next command; otherwise it waits for the command to terminate before proceeding to the next one.

     “&&” and “||” are AND-OR list operators.  “&&” executes the first command, and then executes the second
     command iff the exit status of the first command is zero.  “||” is similar, but executes the second command
     iff the exit status of the first command is nonzero.  “&&” and “||” both have the same priority.

     The syntax of the if command is

           if list
           then list
           [ elif list
           then    list ] ...
           [ else list ]
           fi

     The syntax of the while command is

           while list
           do   list
           done

     The two lists are executed repeatedly while the exit status of the first list is zero.  The until command
     is similar, but has the word until in place of while, which causes it to repeat until the exit status of
     the first list is zero.

     The syntax of the for command is

           for variable [ in [ word ... ] ]
           do   list
           done

     The words following _i_n are expanded, and then the list is executed repeatedly with the variable set to each
     word in turn.  Omitting in word ... is equivalent to in "$@".

     The syntax of the break and continue command is

           break [ num ]
           continue [ num ]

     Break terminates the num innermost for or while loops.  Continue continues with the next iteration of the
     innermost loop.  These are implemented as builtin commands.

     The syntax of the case command is

           case word in
           [(]pattern) list ;;
           ...
           esac

     The pattern can actually be one or more patterns (see _S_h_e_l_l _P_a_t_t_e_r_n_s described later), separated by “|”
     characters.  The “(” character before the pattern is optional.

     Commands may be grouped by writing either

           (list)

     or

           { list; }

     The first of these executes the commands in a subshell.  Builtin commands grouped into a (list) will not
     affect the current shell.  The second form does not fork another shell so is slightly more efficient.
     Grouping commands together this way allows you to redirect their output as though they were one program:

           { printf " hello " ; printf " world\n" ; } > greeting

     Note that “}” must follow a control operator (here, “;”) so that it is recognized as a reserved word and
     not as another command argument.

   FFuunnccttiioonnss
     The syntax of a function definition is

           name () command

     A function definition is an executable statement; when executed it installs a function named name and
     returns an exit status of zero.  The command is normally a list enclosed between “{” and “}”.

     Variables may be declared to be local to a function by using a local command.  This should appear as the
     first statement of a function, and the syntax is

           local [variable | -] ...

     Local is implemented as a builtin command.

     When a variable is made local, it inherits the initial value and exported and readonly flags from the vari‐
     able with the same name in the surrounding scope, if there is one.  Otherwise, the variable is initially
     unset.  The shell uses dynamic scoping, so that if you make the variable x local to function f, which then
     calls function g, references to the variable x made inside g will refer to the variable x declared inside
     f, not to the global variable named x.

     The only special parameter that can be made local is “-”.  Making “-” local any shell options that are
     changed via the set command inside the function to be restored to their original values when the function
     returns.

     The syntax of the return command is

           return [exitstatus]

     It terminates the currently executing function.  Return is implemented as a builtin command.

     The shell maintains a set of parameters.  A parameter denoted by a name is called a variable.  When start‐
     ing up, the shell turns all the environment variables into shell variables.  New variables can be set using
     the form

           name=value

     Variables set by the user must have a name consisting solely of alphabetics, numerics, and underscores -
     the first of which must not be numeric.  A parameter can also be denoted by a number or a special character
     as explained below.

     A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by a number (n > 0).  The shell sets these initially to the
     values of its command line arguments that follow the name of the shell script.  The sseett builtin can also be
     used to set or reset them.

   SSppeecciiaall PPaarraammeetteerrss
     A special parameter is a parameter denoted by one of the following special characters.  The value of the
     parameter is listed next to its character.

     *            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion occurs within a
                  double-quoted string it expands to a single field with the value of each parameter separated
                  by the first character of the IFS variable, or by a ⟨space⟩ if IFS is unset.

     @            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion occurs within
                  double-quotes, each positional parameter expands as a separate argument.  If there are no
                  positional parameters, the expansion of @ generates zero arguments, even when @ is double-
                  quoted.  What this basically means, for example, is if $1 is “abc” and $2 is “def ghi”, then
                  "$@" expands to the two arguments:

                        "abc" "def ghi"

     #            Expands to the number of positional parameters.

     ?            Expands to the exit status of the most recent pipeline.

     - (Hyphen.)  Expands to the current option flags (the single-letter option names concatenated into a
                  string) as specified on invocation, by the set builtin command, or implicitly by the shell.

     $            Expands to the process ID of the invoked shell.  A subshell retains the same value of $ as its
                  parent.

     !            Expands to the process ID of the most recent background command executed from the current
                  shell.  For a pipeline, the process ID is that of the last command in the pipeline.

     0 (Zero.)    Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.

     This clause describes the various expansions that are performed on words.  Not all expansions are performed
     on every word, as explained later.

     Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitutions, arithmetic expansions, and quote removals
     that occur within a single word expand to a single field.  It is only field splitting or pathname expansion
     that can create multiple fields from a single word.  The single exception to this rule is the expansion of
     the special parameter @ within double-quotes, as was described above.

     The order of word expansion is:

     1.   Tilde Expansion, Parameter Expansion, Command Substitution, Arithmetic Expansion (these all occur at
          the same time).

     2.   Field Splitting is performed on fields generated by step (1) unless the IFS variable is null.

     3.   Pathname Expansion (unless set --ff is in effect).

     4.   Quote Removal.

     The $ character is used to introduce parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic evaluation.

     A word beginning with an unquoted tilde character (~) is subjected to tilde expansion.  All the characters
     up to a slash (/) or the end of the word are treated as a username and are replaced with the user's home
     directory.  If the username is missing (as in _~_/_f_o_o_b_a_r), the tilde is replaced with the value of the _H_O_M_E
     variable (the current user's home directory).

   PPaarraammeetteerr EExxppaannssiioonn
     The format for parameter expansion is as follows:

           ${expression}

     where expression consists of all characters until the matching “}”.  Any “}” escaped by a backslash or
     within a quoted string, and characters in embedded arithmetic expansions, command substitutions, and vari‐
     able expansions, are not examined in determining the matching “}”.

     The simplest form for parameter expansion is:

           ${parameter}

     The value, if any, of parameter is substituted.

     The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are optional except for positional parameters
     with more than one digit or when parameter is followed by a character that could be interpreted as part of
     the name.  If a parameter expansion occurs inside double-quotes:

     1.   Pathname expansion is not performed on the results of the expansion.

     2.   Field splitting is not performed on the results of the expansion, with the exception of @.

     In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by using one of the following formats.

     ${parameter:-word}    Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substi‐
                           tuted; otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.

     ${parameter:=word}    Assign Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is
                           assigned to parameter.  In all cases, the final value of parameter is substituted.
                           Only variables, not positional parameters or special parameters, can be assigned in
                           this way.

     ${parameter:?[word]}  Indicate Error if Null or Unset.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of
                           word (or a message indicating it is unset if word is omitted) is written to standard
                           error and the shell exits with a nonzero exit status.  Otherwise, the value of param‐
                           eter is substituted.  An interactive shell need not exit.

     ${parameter:+word}    Use Alternative Value.  If parameter is unset or null, null is substituted; other‐
                           wise, the expansion of word is substituted.

     In the parameter expansions shown previously, use of the colon in the format results in a test for a param‐
     eter that is unset or null; omission of the colon results in a test for a parameter that is only unset.

     ${#parameter}         String Length.  The length in characters of the value of parameter.

     The following four varieties of parameter expansion provide for substring processing.  In each case, pat‐
     tern matching notation (see _S_h_e_l_l _P_a_t_t_e_r_n_s), rather than regular expression notation, is used to evaluate
     the patterns.  If parameter is * or @, the result of the expansion is unspecified.  Enclosing the full
     parameter expansion string in double-quotes does not cause the following four varieties of pattern charac‐
     ters to be quoted, whereas quoting characters within the braces has this effect.

     ${parameter%word}     Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern.  The
                           parameter expansion then results in parameter, with the smallest portion of the suf‐
                           fix matched by the pattern deleted.

     ${parameter%%word}    Remove Largest Suffix Pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern.  The
                           parameter expansion then results in parameter, with the largest portion of the suffix
                           matched by the pattern deleted.

     ${parameter#word}     Remove Smallest Prefix Pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern.  The
                           parameter expansion then results in parameter, with the smallest portion of the pre‐
                           fix matched by the pattern deleted.

     ${parameter##word}    Remove Largest Prefix Pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern.  The
                           parameter expansion then results in parameter, with the largest portion of the prefix
                           matched by the pattern deleted.

     Command substitution allows the output of a command to be substituted in place of the command name itself.
     Command substitution occurs when the command is enclosed as follows:

           $(command)

     or (“backquoted” version):

           `command`

     The shell expands the command substitution by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the
     command substitution with the standard output of the command, removing sequences of one or more ⟨newline⟩s
     at the end of the substitution.  (Embedded ⟨newline⟩s before the end of the output are not removed; how‐
     ever, during field splitting, they may be translated into ⟨space⟩s, depending on the value of IFS and quot‐
     ing that is in effect.)

     Arithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating an arithmetic expression and substituting its
     value.  The format for arithmetic expansion is as follows:

           $((expression))

     The expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes, except that a double-quote inside the expression
     is not treated specially.  The shell expands all tokens in the expression for parameter expansion, command
     substitution, and quote removal.

     Next, the shell treats this as an arithmetic expression and substitutes the value of the expression.

     After parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion the shell scans the results of
     expansions and substitutions that did not occur in double-quotes for field splitting and multiple fields
     can result.

     The shell treats each character of the IFS as a delimiter and uses the delimiters to split the results of
     parameter expansion and command substitution into fields.

     Unless the --ff flag is set, file name generation is performed after word splitting is complete.  Each word
     is viewed as a series of patterns, separated by slashes.  The process of expansion replaces the word with
     the names of all existing files whose names can be formed by replacing each pattern with a string that
     matches the specified pattern.  There are two restrictions on this: first, a pattern cannot match a string
     containing a slash, and second, a pattern cannot match a string starting with a period unless the first
     character of the pattern is a period.  The next section describes the patterns used for both Pathname
     Expansion and the ccaassee command.

   SShheellll PPaatttteerrnnss
     A pattern consists of normal characters, which match themselves, and meta-characters.  The meta-characters
     are “!”, “*”, “?”, and “[”.  These characters lose their special meanings if they are quoted.  When command
     or variable substitution is performed and the dollar sign or back quotes are not double quoted, the value
     of the variable or the output of the command is scanned for these characters and they are turned into meta-
     characters.

     An asterisk (“*”) matches any string of characters.  A question mark matches any single character.  A left
     bracket (“[”) introduces a character class.  The end of the character class is indicated by a (“]”); if the
     “]” is missing then the “[” matches a “[” rather than introducing a character class.  A character class
     matches any of the characters between the square brackets.  A range of characters may be specified using a
     minus sign.  The character class may be complemented by making an exclamation point the first character of
     the character class.

     To include a “]” in a character class, make it the first character listed (after the “!”, if any).  To
     include a minus sign, make it the first or last character listed.

   BBuuiillttiinnss
     This section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because they need to perform some operation that
     can't be performed by a separate process.  In addition to these, there are several other commands that may
     be builtin for efficiency (e.g.  printf(1), echo(1), test(1), etc).

     :

     true   A null command that returns a 0 (true) exit value.

     . file
            The commands in the specified file are read and executed by the shell.

     alias [_n_a_m_e[_=_s_t_r_i_n_g _._._.]]
            If _n_a_m_e_=_s_t_r_i_n_g is specified, the shell defines the alias _n_a_m_e with value _s_t_r_i_n_g.  If just _n_a_m_e is
            specified, the value of the alias _n_a_m_e is printed.  With no arguments, the aalliiaass builtin prints the
            names and values of all defined aliases (see uunnaalliiaass).

     bg [_j_o_b] _._._.
            Continue the specified jobs (or the current job if no jobs are given) in the background.

     command [--pp] [--vv] [--VV] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g _._._.]
            Execute the specified command but ignore shell functions when searching for it.  (This is useful
            when you have a shell function with the same name as a builtin command.)

            --pp     search for command using a PATH that guarantees to find all the standard utilities.

            --VV     Do not execute the command but search for the command and print the resolution of the command
                   search.  This is the same as the type builtin.

            --vv     Do not execute the command but search for the command and print the absolute pathname of
                   utilities, the name for builtins or the expansion of aliases.

     cd _-

     cd [--LLPP] [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y]
            Switch to the specified directory (default HOME).  If an entry for CDPATH appears in the environment
            of the ccdd command or the shell variable CDPATH is set and the directory name does not begin with a
            slash, then the directories listed in CDPATH will be searched for the specified directory.  The for‐
            mat of CDPATH is the same as that of PATH.  If a single dash is specified as the argument, it will
            be replaced by the value of OLDPWD.  The ccdd command will print out the name of the directory that it
            actually switched to if this is different from the name that the user gave.  These may be different
            either because the CDPATH mechanism was used or because the argument is a single dash.  The --PP
            option causes the physical directory structure to be used, that is, all symbolic links are resolved
            to their respective values.  The --LL option turns off the effect of any preceding --PP options.

     echo [--nn] _a_r_g_s_._._.
            Print the arguments on the standard output, separated by spaces.  Unless the --nn option is present, a
            newline is output following the arguments.

            If any of the following sequences of characters is encountered during output, the sequence is not
            output.  Instead, the specified action is performed:

            \b      A backspace character is output.

            \c      Subsequent output is suppressed.  This is normally used at the end of the last argument to
                    suppress the trailing newline that eecchhoo would otherwise output.

            \e      Outputs an escape character (ESC).

            \f      Output a form feed.

            \n      Output a newline character.

            \r      Output a carriage return.

            \t      Output a (horizontal) tab character.

            \v      Output a vertical tab.

            \0_d_i_g_i_t_s
                    Output the character whose value is given by zero to three octal digits.  If there are zero
                    digits, a nul character is output.

            \\      Output a backslash.

            All other backslash sequences elicit undefined behaviour.

     eval _s_t_r_i_n_g _._._.
            Concatenate all the arguments with spaces.  Then re-parse and execute the command.

     exec [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d _a_r_g _._._.]
            Unless command is omitted, the shell process is replaced with the specified program (which must be a
            real program, not a shell builtin or function).  Any redirections on the eexxeecc command are marked as
            permanent, so that they are not undone when the eexxeecc command finishes.

     exit [_e_x_i_t_s_t_a_t_u_s]
            Terminate the shell process.  If _e_x_i_t_s_t_a_t_u_s is given it is used as the exit status of the shell;
            otherwise the exit status of the preceding command is used.

     export _n_a_m_e _._._.

     export --pp
            The specified names are exported so that they will appear in the environment of subsequent commands.
            The only way to un-export a variable is to unset it.  The shell allows the value of a variable to be
            set at the same time it is exported by writing

                  export name=value

            With no arguments the export command lists the names of all exported variables.  With the --pp option
            specified the output will be formatted suitably for non-interactive use.

            The ffcc builtin lists, or edits and re-executes, commands previously entered to an interactive shell.

            --ee editor
                   Use the editor named by editor to edit the commands.  The editor string is a command name,
                   subject to search via the PATH variable.  The value in the FCEDIT variable is used as a
                   default when --ee is not specified.  If FCEDIT is null or unset, the value of the EDITOR vari‐
                   able is used.  If EDITOR is null or unset, ed(1) is used as the editor.

            --ll (ell)
                   List the commands rather than invoking an editor on them.  The commands are written in the
                   sequence indicated by the first and last operands, as affected by --rr, with each command pre‐
                   ceded by the command number.

            --nn     Suppress command numbers when listing with -l.

            --rr     Reverse the order of the commands listed (with --ll) or edited (with neither --ll nor --ss).

            --ss     Re-execute the command without invoking an editor.

            first

            last   Select the commands to list or edit.  The number of previous commands that can be accessed
                   are determined by the value of the HISTSIZE variable.  The value of first or last or both are
                   one of the following:

                   [+]number
                          A positive number representing a command number; command numbers can be displayed with
                          the --ll option.

                   --nnuummbbeerr
                          A negative decimal number representing the command that was executed number of com‐
                          mands previously.  For example, -1 is the immediately previous command.

            string
                   A string indicating the most recently entered command that begins with that string.  If the
                   old=new operand is not also specified with --ss, the string form of the first operand cannot
                   contain an embedded equal sign.

            The following environment variables affect the execution of fc:

            FCEDIT    Name of the editor to use.

            HISTSIZE  The number of previous commands that are accessible.

     fg [_j_o_b]
            Move the specified job or the current job to the foreground.

     getopts _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g _v_a_r
            The POSIX ggeettooppttss command, not to be confused with the _B_e_l_l _L_a_b_s -derived getopt(1).

            The first argument should be a series of letters, each of which may be optionally followed by a
            colon to indicate that the option requires an argument.  The variable specified is set to the parsed
            option.

            The ggeettooppttss command deprecates the older getopt(1) utility due to its handling of arguments contain‐
            ing whitespace.

            The ggeettooppttss builtin may be used to obtain options and their arguments from a list of parameters.
            When invoked, ggeettooppttss places the value of the next option from the option string in the list in the
            shell variable specified by _v_a_r and its index in the shell variable OPTIND.  When the shell is
            invoked, OPTIND is initialized to 1.  For each option that requires an argument, the ggeettooppttss builtin
            will place it in the shell variable OPTARG.  If an option is not allowed for in the _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g, then
            OPTARG will be unset.

            _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g is a string of recognized option letters (see getopt(3)).  If a letter is followed by a
            colon, the option is expected to have an argument which may or may not be separated from it by white
            space.  If an option character is not found where expected, ggeettooppttss will set the variable _v_a_r to a
            “?”; ggeettooppttss will then unset OPTARG and write output to standard error.  By specifying a colon as
            the first character of _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g all errors will be ignored.

            A nonzero value is returned when the last option is reached.  If there are no remaining arguments,
            ggeettooppttss will set _v_a_r to the special option, “--”, otherwise, it will set _v_a_r to “?”.

            The following code fragment shows how one might process the arguments for a command that can take
            the options [a] and [b], and the option [c], which requires an argument.

                  while getopts abc: f
                  do
                          case $f in
                          a | b)  flag=$f;;
                          c)      carg=$OPTARG;;
                          \?)     echo $USAGE; exit 1;;
                          esac
                  done
                  shift `expr $OPTIND - 1`

            This code will accept any of the following as equivalent:

                  cmd -acarg file file
                  cmd -a -c arg file file
                  cmd -carg -a file file
                  cmd -a -carg -- file file

     hash --rrvv _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _._._.
            The shell maintains a hash table which remembers the locations of commands.  With no arguments what‐
            soever, the hhaasshh command prints out the contents of this table.  Entries which have not been looked
            at since the last ccdd command are marked with an asterisk; it is possible for these entries to be
            invalid.

            With arguments, the hhaasshh command removes the specified commands from the hash table (unless they are
            functions) and then locates them.  With the --vv option, hash prints the locations of the commands as
            it finds them.  The --rr option causes the hash command to delete all the entries in the hash table
            except for functions.

     pwd [--LLPP]
            builtin command remembers what the current directory is rather than recomputing it each time.  This
            makes it faster.  However, if the current directory is renamed, the builtin version of ppwwdd will con‐
            tinue to print the old name for the directory.  The --PP option causes the physical value of the cur‐
            rent working directory to be shown, that is, all symbolic links are resolved to their respective
            values.  The --LL option turns off the effect of any preceding --PP options.

     read [--pp _p_r_o_m_p_t] [--rr] _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e [_._._.]
            The prompt is printed if the --pp option is specified and the standard input is a terminal.  Then a
            line is read from the standard input.  The trailing newline is deleted from the line and the line is
            split as described in the section on word splitting above, and the pieces are assigned to the vari‐
            ables in order.  At least one variable must be specified.  If there are more pieces than variables,
            the remaining pieces (along with the characters in IFS that separated them) are assigned to the last
            variable.  If there are more variables than pieces, the remaining variables are assigned the null
            string.  The rreeaadd builtin will indicate success unless EOF is encountered on input, in which case
            failure is returned.

            By default, unless the --rr option is specified, the backslash “\” acts as an escape character, caus‐
            ing the following character to be treated literally.  If a backslash is followed by a newline, the
            backslash and the newline will be deleted.

     readonly _n_a_m_e _._._.

     readonly --pp
            The specified names are marked as read only, so that they cannot be subsequently modified or unset.
            The shell allows the value of a variable to be set at the same time it is marked read only by writ‐
            ing

                  readonly name=value

            With no arguments the readonly command lists the names of all read only variables.  With the --pp
            option specified the output will be formatted suitably for non-interactive use.

     printf _f_o_r_m_a_t [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s _._._.]
            pprriinnttff formats and prints its arguments, after the first, under control of the _f_o_r_m_a_t.  The _f_o_r_m_a_t
            is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply
            copied to standard output, character escape sequences which are converted and copied to the standard
            output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.

            The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding format is either bb, cc or
            ss; otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant, with the following extensions:

                  ··   A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.
                  ··   If the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII code of the
                      next character.

            The format string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s.  Any extra format speci‐
            fications are evaluated with zero or the null string.

            Character escape sequences are in backslash notation as defined in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).
            The characters and their meanings are as follows:

                  \\aa      Write a <bell> character.

                  \\bb      Write a <backspace> character.

                  \\ee      Write an <escape> (ESC) character.

                  \\ff      Write a <form-feed> character.

                  \\nn      Write a <new-line> character.

                  \\rr      Write a <carriage return> character.

                  \\tt      Write a <tab> character.

                  \\vv      Write a <vertical tab> character.

                  \\\\      Write a backslash character.

                  \\_n_u_m    Write an 8-bit character whose ASCII value is the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit octal number _n_u_m.

            Each format specification is introduced by the percent character (``%'').  The remainder of the for‐
            mat specification includes, in the following order:

            Zero or more of the following flags:

                    ##       A `#' character specifying that the value should be printed in an ``alternative
                            form''.  For bb, cc, dd, and ss formats, this option has no effect.  For the oo format
                            the precision of the number is increased to force the first character of the output
                            string to a zero.  For the xx (XX) format, a non-zero result has the string 0x (0X)
                            prepended to it.  For ee, EE, ff, gg, and GG formats, the result will always contain a
                            decimal point, even if no digits follow the point (normally, a decimal point only
                            appears in the results of those formats if a digit follows the decimal point).  For
                            gg and GG formats, trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they would other‐
                            wise be.

                    --       A minus sign `-' which specifies _l_e_f_t _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t of the output in the indicated
                            field;

                    ++       A `+' character specifying that there should always be a sign placed before the num‐
                            ber when using signed formats.

                    ‘ ’     A space specifying that a blank should be left before a positive number for a signed
                            format.  A `+' overrides a space if both are used;

                    00       A zero `0' character indicating that zero-padding should be used rather than blank-
                            padding.  A `-' overrides a `0' if both are used;

            Field Width:
                    An optional digit string specifying a _f_i_e_l_d _w_i_d_t_h; if the output string has fewer characters
                    than the field width it will be blank-padded on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment
                    indicator has been given) to make up the field width (note that a leading zero is a flag,
                    but an embedded zero is part of a field width);

            Precision:
                    An optional period, ‘..’, followed by an optional digit string giving a _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n which spec‐
                    ifies the number of digits to appear after the decimal point, for ee and ff formats, or the
                    maximum number of bytes to be printed from a string (bb and ss formats); if the digit string
                    is missing, the precision is treated as zero;

            Format:
                    A character which indicates the type of format to use (one of ddiioouuxxXXffwwEEggGGbbccss).

            A field width or precision may be ‘**’ instead of a digit string.  In this case an _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t supplies
            the field width or precision.

            The format characters and their meanings are:

            ddiioouuXXxx      The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed as a signed decimal (d or i), unsigned octal, unsigned decimal,
                        or unsigned hexadecimal (X or x), respectively.

            ff           The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed in the style [-]ddd..ddd where the number of d's after the deci‐
                        mal point is equal to the precision specification for the argument.  If the precision is
                        missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision is explicitly 0, no digits and no decimal
                        point are printed.

            eeEE          The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed in the style [-]d..dddee±dd where there is one digit before the
                        decimal point and the number after is equal to the precision specification for the argu‐
                        ment; when the precision is missing, 6 digits are produced.  An upper-case E is used for
                        an `E' format.

            ggGG          The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed in style ff or in style ee (EE) whichever gives full precision in
                        minimum space.

            bb           Characters from the string _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t are printed with backslash-escape sequences
                        expanded.
                        The following additional backslash-escape sequences are supported:

                        \\cc      Causes ddaasshh to ignore any remaining characters in the string operand containing
                                it, any remaining string operands, and any additional characters in the format
                                operand.

                        \\00_n_u_m   Write an 8-bit character whose ASCII value is the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit octal num‐
                                ber _n_u_m.

            cc           The first character of _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed.

            ss           Characters from the string _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t are printed until the end is reached or until the
                        number of bytes indicated by the precision specification is reached; if the precision is
                        omitted, all characters in the string are printed.

            %%           Print a `%'; no argument is used.

            In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a field; padding takes place
            only if the specified field width exceeds the actual width.

     set [{ --ooppttiioonnss | ++ooppttiioonnss | ---- }}] _a_r_g _._._.
            The sseett command performs three different functions.

            With no arguments, it lists the values of all shell variables.

            If options are given, it sets the specified option flags, or clears them as described in the section
            called _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _L_i_s_t _P_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g.  As a special case, if the option is -o or +o and no argument is
            supplied, the shell prints the settings of all its options.  If the option is -o, the settings are
            printed in a human-readable format; if the option is +o, the settings are printed in a format suit‐
            able for reinput to the shell to affect the same option settings.

            The third use of the set command is to set the values of the shell's positional parameters to the
            specified args.  To change the positional parameters without changing any options, use “--” as the
            first argument to set.  If no args are present, the set command will clear all the positional param‐
            eters (equivalent to executing “shift $#”.)

     shift [_n]
            Shift the positional parameters n times.  A sshhiifftt sets the value of _$_1 to the value of _$_2, the value
            of _$_2 to the value of _$_3, and so on, decreasing the value of _$_# by one.  If n is greater than the
            number of positional parameters, sshhiifftt will issue an error message, and exit with return status 2.

     test _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n

     [ _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n ]
            The tteesstt utility evaluates the expression and, if it evaluates to true, returns a zero (true) exit
            status; otherwise it returns 1 (false).  If there is no expression, test also returns 1 (false).

            All operators and flags are separate arguments to the tteesstt utility.

            The following primaries are used to construct expression:

            --bb _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a block special file.

            --cc _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a character special file.

            --dd _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a directory.

            --ff _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a regular file.

            --gg _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and its set group ID flag is set.

            --hh _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a symbolic link.

            --kk _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and its sticky bit is set.

            --nn _s_t_r_i_n_g     True if the length of _s_t_r_i_n_g is nonzero.

            --pp _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e is a named pipe (FIFO).

            --ww _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is writable.  True indicates only that the write flag is on.
                          The file is not writable on a read-only file system even if this test indicates true.

            --xx _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is executable.  True indicates only that the execute flag is
                          on.  If _f_i_l_e is a directory, true indicates that _f_i_l_e can be searched.

            --zz _s_t_r_i_n_g     True if the length of _s_t_r_i_n_g is zero.

            --LL _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and is a symbolic link.  This operator is retained for compatibil‐
                          ity with previous versions of this program.  Do not rely on its existence; use --hh
                          instead.

            --OO _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and its owner matches the effective user id of this process.

            --GG _f_i_l_e       True if _f_i_l_e exists and its group matches the effective group id of this process.

            _f_i_l_e_1 --nntt _f_i_l_e_2
                          True if _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 exist and _f_i_l_e_1 is newer than _f_i_l_e_2.

            _f_i_l_e_1 --oott _f_i_l_e_2
                          True if _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 exist and _f_i_l_e_1 is older than _f_i_l_e_2.

            _f_i_l_e_1 --eeff _f_i_l_e_2
                          True if _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 exist and refer to the same file.

            _s_t_r_i_n_g        True if _s_t_r_i_n_g is not the null string.

            _s_1 == _s_2       True if the strings _s_1 and _s_2 are identical.

            _s_1 !!== _s_2      True if the strings _s_1 and _s_2 are not identical.

            _s_1 << _s_2       True if string _s_1 comes before _s_2 based on the ASCII value of their characters.

            _s_1 >> _s_2       True if string _s_1 comes after _s_2 based on the ASCII value of their characters.

            _n_1 --llee _n_2     True if the integer _n_1 is algebraically less than or equal to the integer _n_2.

            These primaries can be combined with the following operators:

            !! _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n  True if _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is false.

            _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 --aa _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2
                          True if both _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 and _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2 are true.

            _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 --oo _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2
                          True if either _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 or _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2 are true.

            ((_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n))  True if expression is true.

            The --aa operator has higher precedence than the --oo operator.

     times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and for processes run from the shell.  The
            return status is 0.

     trap [_a_c_t_i_o_n _s_i_g_n_a_l _._._.]
            Cause the shell to parse and execute action when any of the specified signals are received.  The
            signals are specified by signal number or as the name of the signal.  If _s_i_g_n_a_l is 0 or EXIT, the
            action is executed when the shell exits.  _a_c_t_i_o_n may be empty (''), which causes the specified sig‐
            nals to be ignored.  With _a_c_t_i_o_n omitted or set to `-' the specified signals are set to their
            default action.  When the shell forks off a subshell, it resets trapped (but not ignored) signals to
            the default action.  The ttrraapp command has no effect on signals that were ignored on entry to the
            shell.  ttrraapp without any arguments cause it to write a list of signals and their associated action
            to the standard output in a format that is suitable as an input to the shell that achieves the same
            trapping results.

            Examples:

                  trap

            List trapped signals and their corresponding action

                  trap '' INT QUIT tstp 30

            Ignore signals INT QUIT TSTP USR1

                  trap date INT

            Print date upon receiving signal INT

     type [_n_a_m_e _._._.]
            Interpret each name as a command and print the resolution of the command search.  Possible resolu‐
            tions are: shell keyword, alias, shell builtin, command, tracked alias and not found.  For aliases
            the alias expansion is printed; for commands and tracked aliases the complete pathname of the com‐
            mand is printed.

     ulimit [--HH | --SS] [--aa | --ttffddssccmmllppnn [_v_a_l_u_e]]
            Inquire about or set the hard or soft limits on processes or set new limits.  The choice between
            hard limit (which no process is allowed to violate, and which may not be raised once it has been
            lowered) and soft limit (which causes processes to be signaled but not necessarily killed, and which
            may be raised) is made with these flags:

            --HH          set or inquire about hard limits

            --SS          set or inquire about soft limits.  If neither --HH nor --SS is specified, the soft limit is
                        displayed or both limits are set.  If both are specified, the last one wins.

            The limit to be interrogated or set, then, is chosen by specifying any one of these flags:

            --aa          show all the current limits

            --tt          show or set the limit on CPU time (in seconds)

            --ff          show or set the limit on the largest file that can be created (in 512-byte blocks)

            --dd          show or set the limit on the data segment size of a process (in kilobytes)

            --ss          show or set the limit on the stack size of a process (in kilobytes)

            --cc          show or set the limit on the largest core dump size that can be produced (in 512-byte
                        blocks)

            --mm          show or set the limit on the total physical memory that can be in use by a process (in
                        kilobytes)

            --ll          show or set the limit on how much memory a process can lock with mlock(2) (in kilobytes)

            --pp          show or set the limit on the number of processes this user can have at one time

            --nn          show or set the limit on the number files a process can have open at once

            --rr          show or set the limit on the real-time scheduling priority of a process

            If none of these is specified, it is the limit on file size that is shown or set.  If value is spec‐
            ified, the limit is set to that number; otherwise the current limit is displayed.

            Limits of an arbitrary process can be displayed or set using the sysctl(8) utility.

     umask [_m_a_s_k]
            Set the value of umask (see umask(2)) to the specified octal value.  If the argument is omitted, the
            umask value is printed.

     unalias [--aa] [_n_a_m_e]
            If _n_a_m_e is specified, the shell removes that alias.  If --aa is specified, all aliases are removed.

     unset [--ffvv] _n_a_m_e _._._.
            The specified variables and functions are unset and unexported.  If --ff or --vv is specified, the cor‐
            responding function or variable is unset, respectively.  If a given name corresponds to both a vari‐
            able and a function, and no options are given, only the variable is unset.

     wait [_j_o_b]
            Wait for the specified job to complete and return the exit status of the last process in the job.
            If the argument is omitted, wait for all jobs to complete and return an exit status of zero.

   CCoommmmaanndd LLiinnee EEddiittiinngg
     When ddaasshh is being used interactively from a terminal, the current command and the command history (see ffcc
     in _B_u_i_l_t_i_n_s) can be edited using vi-mode command-line editing.  This mode uses commands, described below,
     similar to a subset of those described in the vi man page.  The command ‘set -o vi’ enables vi-mode editing
     and place sh into vi insert mode.  With vi-mode enabled, sh can be switched between insert mode and command
     mode.  The editor is not described in full here, but will be in a later document.  It's similar to vi: typ‐
     ing ⟨ESC⟩ will throw you into command VI command mode.  Hitting ⟨return⟩ while in command mode will pass
     the line to the shell.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero
     exit status.  If the shell is not an interactive shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted.
     Otherwise the shell will return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit builtin is
     used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     HOME       Set automatically by login(1) from the user's login directory in the password file (passwd(4)).
                This environment variable also functions as the default argument for the cd builtin.

     PATH       The default search path for executables.  See the above section _P_a_t_h _S_e_a_r_c_h.

     CDPATH     The search path used with the cd builtin.

     MAIL       The name of a mail file, that will be checked for the arrival of new mail.  Overridden by
                MAILPATH.

     MAILCHECK  The frequency in seconds that the shell checks for the arrival of mail in the files specified by
                the MAILPATH or the MAIL file.  If set to 0, the check will occur at each prompt.

     MAILPATH   A colon “:” separated list of file names, for the shell to check for incoming mail.  This envi‐
                ronment setting overrides the MAIL setting.  There is a maximum of 10 mailboxes that can be mon‐
                itored at once.

     PS1        The primary prompt string, which defaults to “$ ”, unless you are the superuser, in which case
                it defaults to “# ”.

     PS2        The secondary prompt string, which defaults to “> ”.

     PS4        Output before each line when execution trace (set -x) is enabled, defaults to “+ ”.

     IFS        Input Field Separators.  This is normally set to ⟨space⟩, ⟨tab⟩, and ⟨newline⟩.  See the _W_h_i_t_e
                _S_p_a_c_e _S_p_l_i_t_t_i_n_g section for more details.

     TERM       The default terminal setting for the shell.  This is inherited by children of the shell, and is
                used in the history editing modes.

     HISTSIZE   The number of lines in the history buffer for the shell.

     PWD        The logical value of the current working directory.  This is set by the ccdd command.

     OLDPWD     The previous logical value of the current working directory.  This is set by the ccdd command.

     PPID       The process ID of the parent process of the shell.
